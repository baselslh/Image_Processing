# Image_Processing
 
## General info 
This are the assignments that i had to complete in image processing 1 course

## 1. Task 1
a. Experiment 1:

- Choose an image with low contrast and work with it as gray image
- Plot its histogram
- Plot its cumulative histogram
- Perform histogram equalization
- Plot the modified image
- Plot the modified image histogram
- Plot the modified image cumulative histogram

b. Experiment 2:
- Choose an image with low contrast whose pixels not occupy the full dynamic range and work with it as gray image.
- Deduce the original image range from a to b [min and max of image pixels]
- Plot its histogram
- Apply contrast stretching on image pixels to utilize the full dynamic range [0,255]
- Display the new image
- Plot the modified image histogram

## 2. Task 2
a. Experiment 1 (smoothing):
- Using any gray scale image:
- Add salt & pepper noise to the given image.
- for the noisy image Apply different smoothing filters with different window size:
- (Average, median, rank order with different ranks).
- Explain briefly the following questions:
  1. Which smoothing filter removes the noise in a better way? Why?
  2. What is the effect of changing the window size?
  3. When utilizing the rank order filter, what is the effect of changing the rank?

b. Experiment 2 (sharpening):
- Using any gray scale image:
- Apply different sharpening filters (Perwitt, Sobel, laplacian, log).
